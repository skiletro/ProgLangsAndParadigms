ProgLangsAndParadigms
---

This was a university assignment to write the same program in three different
languages, using completely different paradigms. While the programs are not
completely identical, they serve as a way to demonstrate how a task can be
done using different programming paradigms.

The task implemented is a simple tac-tac-toe game (details found in
task_proposal.txt), and was written in Go, Haskell, and Python, using the
functional, imperative, and object-oriented paradigms respectively.
