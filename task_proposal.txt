My proposed task is a tic-tac-toe like game, which would be implemented as
follows:
- A 4 by 4 grid (instead of a 3 by 3 grid in a typical tic-tac-toe game)
- 2 players (represented using X and O, or some other representation that is
  clear to the user)
- Players choose where to put their piece, and after their turn is over, the
  board shifts around, with the inner and outer part of the 4x4 grid shifting
  clockwise.
- The game is won by getting 4 in a row (either horizontal, vertical, or
  diagonal)

For example, say a player places a character in slot 1, 4 of the grid

---X
----
----
----

After their turn, the inner and outer grid would rotate clockwise and would
result in this grid arrangement:

----
---X
----
----

The next player places their piece in 2, 2:

----
-O-X
----
----

And after their turn ends, the inner and outer grid rotates clockwise resulting
in:

----
--O-
---X
----

In order to personalise the task, a robotic second player will be used with an
RNG seed of 99693381 (this used to be my student ID number, but has since been
replaced with a random 8 digit number).
